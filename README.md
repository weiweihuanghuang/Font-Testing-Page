 From the original README.MD
> 
> The Font Testing Page is a tool primarily intended for type designers and independent foundries to 'Drag and Drop' their work in progress into a browser. It can also be used by art directors, graphic designers, teachers and students interested in seeing how a typeface works on the web.
> 
> There is a short video demonstrating this tool, http://vimeo.com/40296571
> 
> Operation is simple:
> 
> - Drag the font you want to try to the upper area of the Testing Page
> - Add more fonts and you'll see their file names and file sizes as buttons
> 
> Below the drop area you see some buttons to select different layouts:
> 
> - Headlines: Displays examples: 72, 60, 48, 36 and 30 to 12.
> - Text: Displays text blocks, from 20 to 10.
> - Adhesion: Shows examples using only 'adhesion' text. Intended for the early stages on a typeface design.
